Usage: ./archsim.py [binary file] [hexdump file]
Do `cat [hexdump file]` to see hexdump output

This program is a MIPS simulator that currently just takes in a binary file containing MIPS instructions and writes the hexdump representation of the input file out to the given hexdump file name.

== Changelog ==
04.05.2012 - The program now prints the register and memory content to standard output in addition to the hexdump file.
