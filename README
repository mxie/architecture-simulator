Usage: ./run_sim.py [binary file]

Or, to write output to a file instead of standard output:
./run_sim.py [binary file] >[output file]

This program is a MIPS simulator that reads in a binary file, simulates the instructions, and outputs register and memory content, instruction and cycle count, and CPI.
